# DEMO_WOW_STRATEGY

## 1) Slides that deserve ZERO changes
- **Slide01** (`components/slides/Slide01.tsx`): message is clear and interaction is already simple/reliable.
- **Slide02** (`components/slides/Slide02.tsx`): slider metaphor is effective; avoid over-design.
- **Slide14 / component Slide15** (`components/slides/Slide15.tsx`): numeric summary should remain crisp and low-friction.
- **Slide18** (`components/slides/Slide18.tsx`): objection-handling is clear; keep it readable over flashy.
- **Slide19** (`components/slides/Slide19.tsx`): closing conviction works best with restraint.

## 2) Slides ideal for WOW upgrades
- **Slide00**: first-impression cinematic authority.
- **Slide04**: strongest proof/evidence interactivity already present.
- **Slide11 (component Slide12)**: best candidate for product-grade UI feel.
- **Slide12 (component Slide13)**: KPI spotlight opportunities with low implementation risk.
- **Slide17**: case-evidence reveal can become a memorable proof beat.

## 3) Slides dangerous to touch
- **Slide09** (`components/slides/Slide09.tsx`): highest complexity and interaction density.
- **Slide16** (`components/slides/Slide16.tsx`): monolithic architecture, high blast radius.
- **Slide06** (`components/slides/Slide06.tsx`): many style/timing systems intertwined.
- **Slide7** (`components/slides/Slide7.tsx`): interaction-state heavy with keyboard/mouse/timer coupling.

## 4) AI interaction: natural vs forced

### Natural
- **After Slide04**: investor asks “how do you prove this under audit pressure?”
- **After Slide11 (Slide12 component)**: investor asks “what module drives ROI fastest in first 60 days?”
- **After Slide15/16**: investor asks scenario question (downside/base/upside) for decision framing.

### Forced
- **Slides 00–02**: opening arc should stay visual and declarative, not conversational AI yet.
- **Slide03/05**: credibility buildup is stronger through visuals than AI interruption.
- **Slide19**: close should end on conviction/CTA, not a chatbot interaction.

## Execution Principle for Next Block
- Target **high-impact + low-risk** first (Slide00, Slide04, Slide11).
- Keep every WOW behind default-OFF flags.
- Avoid touching keyboard authority and cross-slide orchestration unless strictly required.
