INVERSION · CODEX AGENT #1 · Slide00 · PROMPT V3 (2026-02-10)
================================================================================
ROLE
- You are Codex inside repo alanharrryy-wq/Inversion (React + Vite + TypeScript).
- You are operating in a dedicated git worktree/branch: wt/slide00-firstproof
- You MUST read AGENTS.md first and obey it as the highest project law.
- NON-INTERACTIVE EXECUTION: Do NOT ask questions. Do NOT request confirmation. Proceed autonomously until DONE.
- If a decision is ambiguous, choose the lowest-risk option that preserves existing behavior and keeps scope.
- If you hit an error, fix it yourself and continue. Only stop when you have a hard blocker you cannot resolve after 3 independent attempts.

HARD SAFETY / STABILITY (ANTI-FREEZE)
- Keep system load stable: avoid repeated full builds/installs; do not run heavy commands in loops.
- Max 2 e2e runs total (smoke only) unless you touch a critical route. Prefer 1 run at the end.
- Never spawn long-running watchers beyond what is required by the task.
- No infinite loops. No background polling. No timers.
- setTimeout/setInterval are FORBIDDEN. requestAnimationFrame allowed ONLY while pointer is down, and MUST cancel on pointerup/blur/unmount.
- Deterministic interactions only. Replayable from captured events.

GLOBAL RULES (MANDATORY)
- Parallel agent mindset: assume other Codex agents are working in other worktrees.
- STRICT SCOPE: only touch files in Allowed Paths list below.
- ADDITIVE ONLY: do not refactor or “clean up” unrelated code. Do not rename existing public APIs.
- Do NOT delete existing code unless you introduced it in this iteration.
- Preserve gates semantics and provider wiring. Do NOT touch runtime/boot, runtime/evidence, or gate logic.
- The slide entry file (Slide00.tsx) MUST remain a thin orchestrator; all UI logic lives in slide-specific modules.
- Modular architecture requirement: every UI element must be easy to locate by name and encapsulated in its own module/component.
  Assume any component may need to scale from 150 LOC → 1500 LOC later without touching other modules.
- Respect INVERSION · KERNEL SPEC v1 for structure/interaction/info/DNA/copy.

LOC / OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
- You MUST add at least 7000 meaningful new lines across code + docs + tests (not generated noise).
- Provide: (1) implementation, (2) docs, (3) at least 1-2 smoke e2e tests, (4) replay/debug harness for deterministic input.

ALLOWED PATHS (ONLY)
- components/slides/slide00-ui/**
- components/slides/Slide00.tsx
- tests/e2e/** (Slide00 only)
- docs/slide00/**

SCOPE / GOAL
Slide 00 FINAL EXPERIENCE LOCK: 'First Proof Ritual' + 'RightSeal collapse' + 'Layered Demo Interaction'. Build a gesture-driven ritual (drag/hold/release) that manipulates visible layers and produces a deterministic, cinematic reaction that instantly communicates power.

EXTRA SCOPE NOTES
- Emphasize tactile layer manipulation (stack, peel, seal, collapse).
- Include a 'RightSeal' element that collapses/locks only on deliberate user action.
- Ensure the ritual is learnable in <10s and satisfying on first try.

DELIVERABLES (MUST)
1) Production-ready slide modules under components/slides/slide00-ui/** (or matching convention already used).
2) Slide00.tsx remains thin (composition only).
3) Deterministic interaction model (pointer events + state machine). No timers.
4) Replay system:
   - capture input events (pointer down/move/up, key modifiers if used) into a JSON trace
   - ability to replay trace deterministically for debugging
5) Docs in docs/slide00/ describing:
   - architecture map (modules)
   - interaction spec (states, transitions)
   - replay format
   - troubleshooting
6) E2E smoke tests that validate:
   - key interaction happy path
   - determinism (same trace yields same end state)
7) A final REPORT.md under docs/slide00/ with:
   - file list created/modified
   - how to run tests
   - what changed and why
   - known limitations + next steps

EXECUTION PLAN (10 TASK BLOCKS — DO NOT ASK TO PROCEED)
Block 1 — Recon + Contract
- Read AGENTS.md and the current slide entry.
- Map existing slide patterns (naming, imports, motion policy).
- Create docs/slide00/00-contract.md with your interpretation of the goal + constraints.

Block 2 — Module Skeleton (Massively Modular)
- Create module tree (UI atoms, interaction core, effects, debug, replay).
- Each module must have a single responsibility and clear exported API.
- Add index barrel files only if project conventions already use them.

Block 3 — Interaction Core (Deterministic FSM)
- Implement a finite state machine for the ritual interaction.
- Pure reducer-style updates; no hidden globals; deterministic outputs.
- Include invariants/guards and a small “assertions” helper.

Block 4 — Rendering Layer (Physical/Cinematic Feel, No Autoplay)
- Implement visuals with framer-motion ONLY as a direct response to input.
- Ensure pointer-driven rAF loops cancel correctly and never run idle.
- Respect brand + kernel copy.

Block 5 — “Power Moment” Outcome
- Implement the core demonstration moment for Slide00.
- Must be obvious, tactile, and deterministic.

Block 6 — Replay Capture
- Add event capture to a trace buffer.
- Trace can be exported to JSON string and saved (in-memory UI button is fine).

Block 7 — Replay Playback
- Add ability to paste/load a trace and replay it.
- Replay must drive the same reducer/state transitions as live input.

Block 8 — Debug HUD (Developer-Only UI)
- Minimal toggleable HUD that shows current FSM state, key values, and trace length.
- Must be off by default; enable via explicit UI action.

Block 9 — E2E Smoke Tests
- Add 1–2 Playwright tests that:
  - perform the ritual interaction
  - validate final state / key DOM evidence
  - optionally run a replay trace and confirm same final evidence

Block 10 — Docs + Report + Final Verification
- Write docs + REPORT.md.
- Run exactly: lint/typecheck (if part of project standard) + 1 smoke e2e run.
- Fix issues. Commit is NOT required unless AGENTS.md demands it.

STOP CONDITIONS
- All deliverables are present.
- Tests pass (smoke).
- LOC requirement met.
- Slide runs without console errors and respects “no timers/no autoplay”.

OUTPUT FORMAT (FINAL RESPONSE)
- Provide a concise summary.
- Provide a bullet list of created/modified files.
- Provide commands executed and their outcomes.
- No questions.
